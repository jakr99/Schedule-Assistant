# 40-Hour Weekly Limit Warning Implementation

## Overview
Added a warning/alert system that flags workers scheduled over the 40-hour per week limit during schedule validation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `app/validation.py`

#### Added new validation function: `_weekly_hours_warnings()`
- **Location**: Lines 153-186
- **Purpose**: Checks if any employee exceeds the maximum weekly hours limit
- **Logic**:
  - Reads the `max_hours_week` setting from policy (defaults to 40)
  - Calculates total hours per employee from all shifts in the week
  - Flags employees exceeding the limit with a tolerance of 1e-6 for floating point precision
  - Returns warnings in the standard format

#### Warning Structure
Each warning includes:
- `type`: "weekly_hours" (for filtering)
- `severity`: "warning" (non-blocking)
- `employee_id`: ID of the affected employee
- `employee`: Employee name
- `hours`: Total scheduled hours (rounded to 2 decimals)
- `limit`: The policy's maximum weekly hours (default 40)
- `message`: Human-readable description with overage amount

#### Integration into validation flow
- Added call to `_weekly_hours_warnings()` in `validate_week_schedule()` (line 69)
- Warnings are appended to the existing warnings list
- Works alongside existing validation checks (availability, coverage, concurrency, etc.)

### 2. Added Test Coverage in `tests/test_validation.py`

Three new test cases:

1. **`test_warns_when_employee_exceeds_40_hours`** (lines 106-125)
   - Creates shifts totaling 42 hours
   - Verifies a warning is generated
   - Confirms warning has correct employee ID and hour values

2. **`test_no_warning_for_employee_at_40_hours`** (lines 127-144)
   - Creates shifts totaling exactly 40 hours
   - Verifies NO warning is generated (boundary case)

3. **`test_no_warning_for_employee_under_40_hours`** (lines 146-163)
   - Creates shifts totaling 30 hours
   - Verifies NO warning is generated

## How to Use

### Via API
When calling the validation endpoint, the response will now include warnings:
```
GET /api/v1/schedules/{week_start}/validate
```

Response includes:
```json
{
  "week_start": "2024-04-01",
  "week_id": 123,
  "issues": [...],
  "warnings": [
    {
      "type": "weekly_hours",
      "severity": "warning",
      "employee_id": 5,
      "employee": "John Doe",
      "hours": 42.5,
      "limit": 40,
      "message": "John Doe is scheduled 42.5 hours (exceeds 40-hour limit by 2.5 hours)."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Manual Schedule Validation
If validation is called directly in code:
```python
from validation import validate_week_schedule

report = validate_week_schedule(session, week_start, employee_session=employee_session)
hours_warnings = [w for w in report["warnings"] if w["type"] == "weekly_hours"]
```

## Policy Configuration
The maximum weekly hours limit is configured via the policy's global settings:
```json
{
  "global": {
    "max_hours_week": 40,
    ...
  }
}
```

This value is what the warning system uses for comparison.

## Key Features
- ✅ Respects policy-configured hour limits
- ✅ Floating-point safe comparison
- ✅ Clear, actionable warning messages
- ✅ Includes overage amount
- ✅ Integrates seamlessly with existing validation
- ✅ Non-blocking (warnings, not errors)
- ✅ Covers boundary cases (exactly at limit, over limit, under limit)
