Version beta-00006
- Made main window content scrollable via QScrollArea to ensure traversibility across devices (PC/laptop) and varying screen sizes/DPI.

- Corrected sales heat map math: modifiers now apply proportionally to the time window they occupy, not to the entire day.
- Added cross‑midnight handling so late-night modifiers contribute their post‑midnight portion to the following day.
- Kept UI concise: tooltips show a single duration-weighted net change, without per‑modifier daily breakdown.
