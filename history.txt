Schedule Assistant history
==========================

Version beta-00001
- Created the repository and scaffolded the initial project layout.

Version beta-00002
- Brought up the PySide6 desktop shell with role-aware login gating and a minimal dashboard.
- Added a JSON-backed account store seeded with the IT assistant credentials so the app is usable on first launch.

Version beta-00003
- Hardened authentication by moving to salted PBKDF2 hashes and wiring in self-service password changes.
- Enforced role-aware rules for creating/deleting accounts and added the Python launcher that bootstraps `.venv` with one command.

Version beta-00004
- Implemented centralized audit logging that captures every login attempt and account lifecycle event.
- Added a configurable lockout policy with on-screen status inside the Account Manager so GMs can clear or review incidents quickly.

Version beta-00005
- Introduced Buffalo Wild Wings role presets, employee start-date tracking, and the first pass of the SQLite/SQLAlchemy data layer.
- Expanded the Employee Directory with active/inactive filters, availability editing, and audit notes for each change.
- Added the persistent ISO week selector with saved contexts plus a 9-minute inactivity warning and 10-minute auto sign-out.

Version beta-00006
- Wrapped the main window in QScrollArea and refreshed layouts so the UI survives varying DPI and laptop screens.

Version beta-00007
- Fixed the sales heat-map math so modifiers apply only to their time windows and correctly split across midnight.
- Simplified tooltips to a single duration-weighted delta so shift editors see clear net effects.

Version beta-00008
- Renamed Demand Planning to Week Preparation and introduced the dedicated Validate / Import / Export tab.
- Added JSON import/export for employees, projections, modifiers, and week schedules, including week-to-week copy helpers and audit logging for every transfer.
- Refreshed the theme (charcoal palette, calmer login dialog) and rebuilt the seeded roster with realistic availability notes.

Version beta-00009
- Matched the Employee Directory dialog width to the main window for easier roster scanning.
- Polished the Validate / Import / Export hub and added Week Schedule multi-select controls for swap or grant actions.
- Shipped the Policy Composer so GMs edit guardrails, time blocks, and per-role coverage without touching raw JSON, and the generator now honors those structured rules.

Version beta-00010
- Extended the Policy Composer with operating-hours inputs, open/close buffers, and anchor-aware block definitions (`@open`, `@close`).
- Updated the generator to respect the anchors/buffers, improve role matching, and surface clearer coverage warnings.
- Synced README, TODO, and automated tests with the new scheduling workflow so IT/HR can follow the process end to end.

Version beta-00011
- Week Preparation and Week Schedule now power the full weekly workflow with live projections, modifiers, and coverage editing.
- Validate / Import / Export manages employees, projections, modifiers, and shift grids with audit-ready history.
- Week Schedule grid gained inline hints plus faster swap/grant UX, Employee Directory borrowed the new palette, and the seed data grew to 39 active employees so generator smoke tests feel like a real store.
